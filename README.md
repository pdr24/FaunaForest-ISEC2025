## About
FaunaForest was created by Pragathi Durga Rajarajan and Adrian Cisneros as part of the the Developing AI Tools for K-12 course at the University of Texas at San Antonio, under the guidance of Dr. Fred Martin. A full paper was published at the IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (2025).

FaunaForest aims to teach middle school students (grades 6-8) about decision trees via 3 levels of interactive decision tree puzzles. Each puzzle involves completing a decision tree that has blank mystery nodes in such a way that it will correctly classify various animals.
